# MovieMatch Frontend

This is the frontend for MovieMatch - a movie recommendation website with AI-powered mood analysis.

## Deployment

This frontend is designed to be deployed as a static site. It can be deployed to services like:
- Render (Static Site)
- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages

## Backend Integration

This frontend connects to a separate backend service that provides AI-powered movie recommendations. The backend must be deployed separately and the URL configured in `script.js`.

## Git LFS Note

Unlike the backend, this frontend repository does not require Git LFS as all files are under GitHub's size limits.
